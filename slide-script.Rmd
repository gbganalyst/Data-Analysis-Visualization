# Introduction to pipe operator

```

## The Pipe Operator `<%>`

.w-100.lh-copy[
What if you wanted to apply multiple functions to one data frame? This is where chaining is elegant and facilitates debugging.

The pipe operator is an extremely useful tool from the `magrittr` package that allows you to express a sequence of multiple operations. They can greatly simplify your code and make your operations more intuitive. 

You want to call one function, then pass the result to another function, and another, in a way that is easily readable.
]

--

.w-100.lh-copy[
For example, when you have an input `data` and want to call functions `foo` and `bar` in sequence, you can write it as follows:
]

--

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
data %>% foo() %>% bar()
```
]

--

.pull-right[

`instead of`:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
bar(foo(data))
```
]

--

The easiest way to get `%>%` is to load `tidyverse` or `dplyr package`.

---

### Example 1

--

```{r, echo=TRUE}
iris %>% head()
```

--

`instead of`: 

--

```{r, echo=TRUE}
head(iris)
```

---

## The Pipe Operator `<%>`

.w-100.lh-copy[
Piping is the clearest syntax to implement, as it focuses on actions, not objects. The pipe operator `(%>%)` automatically passes the output from the first line into the next line as the input.
]

--

.w-100.lh-copy[
Imagine, that you have a function that takes two arguments: 

`function(argument1, argument2)`
]

--

.w-100.lh-copy[
If you wanted to write the piece of code with the pipe operator (`%>%`),  you would write it as:
]

--

.w-100.lh-copy[

`argument1 %>% function(argument2)`

where the pipe operator automatically places argument1 as the first argument of the function.

]

---

### Example 2

--

```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
x <-  4.234

x %>% sqrt() %>% log() %>% round(2)
```
--

or

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x <-  4.234

x %>% sqrt() %>% log() %>% round(2)
```

--

`instead of`: 

--

```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
x <- 4.234

round(log(sqrt(x)), 2)
```

## Introduction to dplyr package

.w-100.lh-copy[
dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.


### Installation

The easiest way to get dplyr is to install the whole tidyverse:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
]


---
class: middle

# dplyr verbs

.w-100.lh-copy[
The five key dplyr functions also knows as dplyr verbs that allow you to solve the vast majority of your data manipulation challenges are:
]

.w-100.lh-copy[

- `select()`: picks variables based on their names or column positions.

- `mutate()`: adds new variables that are functions of existing variables

- `filter()`: picks cases based on their values

- `arrange()`:  changes the ordering of the rows by values of a column
(low to high). This is the same thing that the **sort** feature in MS-Excel does.

- `summarise()`: reduces multiple values down to a single summary.

]

---
class: middle

## Other dplyr functions

.w-100.lh-copy[

- `rename()`: rename the columns of a dataframe	

- `distinct()`: Select only unique/distinct rows from a data frame

- `count()`: lets you quickly count the unique values of one or more variables

- `group_by()`: group by one or more variables

When `summarise()` is paired with `group_by()`, it allows you to get a summary row for each group in the data frame.

---

`group_by()` and `summarise()` provide one of the tools that youâ€™ll use most commonly when working with dplyr: grouped summaries.

]

---
class: middle

.w-100.lh-copy[
All of the dplyr functions (i.e. verbs) share a similar syntax. You can use them like this:
]

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="90%"}
include_graphics("images/dplyr2.png")
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("images/dplyr3.png")
```

## Data Visualization

.w-100.lh-copy[
Data visualization refers to the graphical representation of data by visual elements such as charts, Infographics, and maps to understand the data. 
]

.pull-left[
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height= "30%", out.width="82%"}
  include_graphics("images/viz.png")
```
]

--

.w-100.lh-copy[
There is a story behind every data and data visualization brings them to life.
]

--

.w-100.lh-copy[
The importance of Data Visualization is as follows:
]

<br>

--

.w-100.lh-copy[
- It is a powerful way to explore data with presentable results
  
- It displays the summary of your data at a glance
  
- Charts make it easier to identify patterns and trends
  
- It helps to identify areas that need attention or improvement.
]

--
.w-100.lh-copy[
It can be hard for the audience to grasp the true meaning of the findings without data visualization.

### Before you visualize your data

.w-100.lh-copy[
Presentation of data and information is not just about picking any data visualization design. Matching data to the right visualization begins by answering the following five (5) key questions:
]

--


- What relationship am I trying to understand between my data sets?

--

- Do I want to understand the distribution of data and look for outliers?

--

- Am I looking to compare multiple values or looking to analyze a single value over time?

--

- Am I interested in analyzing trends in my data sets?

--

- Is this visualization an important part of my overarching data story?

## Data visualization using ggplot2 


.w-100.lh-copy[
R has several systems for making graphs, but ggplot2 is one of the most elegant and most versatile. `ggplot2` is based on the grammar of graphics, the idea that you can build every graph from the same components: 

- a data set

- a coordinate system also known as aesthetic mapping

- geoms: visual marks that represent data points.

With ggplot2, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.

`x`: variable on the x-axis 

`y`: variable on the y-axis

 ]
]

.w-100.lh-copy[

`size`: size of the points
 
`shape`: shape of the points

`group`: identifies series of points with a grouping variable

`facet`: create small multiples

## Summary

.left[
.w-100.lh-copy[
This tutorial introduced you to pipe operator (`%>%`) in `R` programming. 

In this tutorial, you have learnt that:

1. there are many dplyr verbs and they include `select()`, `mutate()`, `filter()`, `group_by()`, and `summarise()`.

2. you can use any visualization technique to plot data with ggplot2 package.

3. you can choose from different layers such as `geom_point()`, `geom_col()`, `geom_histogram()`, `geom_boxplot()`, etc.
